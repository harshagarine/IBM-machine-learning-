# IBM-machine-learning
machine learning project as a part of course
In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we learned in this course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, 
and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
Using the test set to report the accuracy of the model with the following algorithms:

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
